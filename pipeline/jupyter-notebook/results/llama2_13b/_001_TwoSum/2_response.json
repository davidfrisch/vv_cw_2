{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 63, "response": " The error message you're seeing is because the Java compiler is expecting a class, interface, or enum definition, but instead it finds a method definition. To fix this issue, you need to wrap the method definition in a class, like this:\n```\npublic class TwoSum {\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        // Your method implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will tell the Java compiler that the `twoSum` method is part of a class, and it will be able to compile correctly."}
