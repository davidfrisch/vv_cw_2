The hash map is initialized with all integers as keys and -1 as values. Then, it iterates through the array of integers and updates the hash map with the current number and its index. Finally, it searches for the first pair of numbers that add up to the target and returns their indices.",

The `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` keeps track of the indices of the numbers that have already been used, and the `containsKey()` method is used to check if a given number has already been used. If a number has already been used, the function returns its index and the index of the current number. If no numbers have been used yet, the function adds the current number to the hash map and continues iterating until it finds two numbers that sum up to the target.",
