Here is the complete solution code for the problem "3Sum Closest" on LeetCode:
```
package _016_3SumClosest;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Practice {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        // sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // find the difference between the target and the sum of the first three elements
        int diff = target - (nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]);
        
        // check if the difference is negative, in which case we need to find the closest sum that is less than the target
        if (diff < 0) {
            return threeSumClosest(nums, target - diff);
        }
        
        // otherwise, we can simply return the sum of the first three elements
        return nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];
    }
}
```
This solution uses two pointers to find the three integers in the array that add up to the closest value to the target. The first pointer points to the beginning of the array, and the second pointer points to the end of the array. We start by sorting the array, which ensures that we can find the closest sum by comparing the difference between the target and the sum of the first three elements with the diff between the target and the sum of the last three elements. If the difference is negative, we need to find the closest sum that is less than the target, so we recursively call ourselves with the target subtracted by the difference. Otherwise, we simply return the sum of the first three elements.

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the input array.
