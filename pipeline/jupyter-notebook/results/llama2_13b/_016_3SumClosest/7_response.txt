 Sure! Here is the complete Java code for the `threeSumClosest` method:

package _016_3SumClosest;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Practice {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        // sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // find the difference between the target and the sum of the first three elements
        int diff = target - (nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]);
        
        // check if the difference is negative, in which case we need to find the closest sum that is less than the target
        if (diff < 0) {
            return threeSumClosest(nums, target - diff);
        }
        
        // otherwise, we can simply return the sum of the first three elements
        return nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];
    }
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
