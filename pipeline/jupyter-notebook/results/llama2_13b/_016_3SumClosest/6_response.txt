Here is the corrected Java code:

package _016_3SumClosest;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class Practice {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int diff = target - (nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2]);
        
        if (diff < 0) {
            return threeSumClosest(nums, target - diff);
        }
        
        return nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];
    }
}

Note: The only change made was adding a closing brace '}' at the end of the method.
