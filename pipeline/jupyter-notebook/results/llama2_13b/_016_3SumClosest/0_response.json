The first pointer points to the beginning of the array, and the second pointer points to the end of the array. We start by sorting the array, which ensures that we can find the closest sum by comparing the difference between the target and the sum of the first three elements with the diff between the target and the sum of the last three elements. If the difference is negative, we need to find the closest sum that is less than the target, so we recursively call ourselves with the target subtracted by the difference. Otherwise, we simply return the sum of the first three elements.\n\nNote that this solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(1), where n is the length of the input array."}
