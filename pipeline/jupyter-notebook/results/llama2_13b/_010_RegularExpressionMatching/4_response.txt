 The error message indicates that the Java compiler is expecting a class, interface, or enum, but it is not finding one in the code. Specifically, it is looking for a class or interface called "Practice" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`.

The code provided does not define any classes or interfaces, so the compiler is throwing an error. To fix the issue, you need to define a class or interface called "Practice" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`.

Here is an example of how you can define a class called "Practice" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`:
```
public class Practice {
    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        // Implement the regular expression matching logic here
        return true; // or false if the match fails
    }
}
```
