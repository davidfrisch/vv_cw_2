Here is the complete solution code for the problem "Regular Expression Matching" on LeetCode:
```
package _010_RegularExpressionMatching;

import java.util.Stack;

public class Practice {

    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        // Create a stack to keep track of the current state
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Iterate over the input string (s) and check if it matches the pattern (p)
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);

            // If the current character is a wildcard (. or *), push it onto the stack
            if (c == '.' || c == '*') {
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                // If the current character does not match the top element on the stack, pop the stack
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() != c) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }

        // If the stack is empty after iterating over the input string, return true
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }

}
```
Explanation:

The solution uses a stack to keep track of the current state of the input string and the pattern. The stack is initialized with the wildcard characters '.' and '*'.

For each character in the input string, we check if it matches the top element on the stack. If it does not match, we pop the stack. If it does match or there is no top element on the stack, we push the current character onto the stack.

Finally, we return true if the stack is empty after iterating over the input string, indicating that the pattern matches the input string.

Note: This solution assumes that the input strings and patterns are valid regular expressions.
