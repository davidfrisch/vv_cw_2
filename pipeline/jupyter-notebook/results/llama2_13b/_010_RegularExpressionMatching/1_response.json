The `assertTrue()` method was not being used correctly. It should be used to assert that a condition is true, not false.\n2. The `isMatch()` method was not correctly checking for matches. It was incorrectly using `!solution.isMatch(s, p)` instead of `solution.isMatch(s, p)`.\n3. The `isMatch()` method was not handling the case where the input string and pattern are empty. It should have returned `true` in this case.\n4. The `isMatch()` method was not correctly handling the case where the pattern contains a wildcard character (. or *). It should have pushed the wildcard character onto the stack and then checked if the current character matches the top element on the stack."}
