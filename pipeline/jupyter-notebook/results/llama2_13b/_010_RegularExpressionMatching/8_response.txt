 The error message you provided is not very helpful, but I can try to help you understand what's going on.

It looks like the problem is with the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes, which are part of the Java Standard Library. These classes are used for working with regular expressions, and it seems that the code is trying to use them in a way that is not allowed.

Here's the relevant code from the error message:
```
    Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(p);
    Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
```
The first line compiles a `Pattern` object from the string `p`, but the second line tries to use the `Matcher` class on a `String` object called `s`. This is not allowed, because `Matcher` is a class that is meant to be used with `Pattern` objects, not with strings.

To fix this error, you need to change the code so that it uses `Pattern` and `Matcher` correctly. Here's an example of how you could do this:
```
public class Practice {
    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(p);
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(s);
        return matcher.find();
    }
}
```
In this example, we compile the `Pattern` object from the string `p`, and then use the `Matcher` object to search for matches in the string `s`. This should fix the error you're seeing.
