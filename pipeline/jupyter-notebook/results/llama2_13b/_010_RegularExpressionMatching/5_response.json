{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 3, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": " Sure, I can help you with that! The error message you're seeing is because the `Practice` class is not defined in the file `PracticeTest.java`. To fix this, you need to define the `Practice` class in a separate file, and then import it into the `PracticeTest` class. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n1. Create a new file called `Practice.java` in the same directory as your other source files.\n2. Define the `Practice` class in this file, like this:\n```\npublic class Practice {\n    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {\n        // Implement the regular expression matching logic here\n        return true; // or false if the match fails\n    }\n}\n```\n3. In your `PracticeTest` class, import the `Practice` class like this:\n```\nimport static com.leetcode.Practice.isMatch;\n```\n4. Use the `Practice` class in your test methods like this:\n```\npublic class PracticeTest {\n    @Test\n    public void testIsMatch() {\n        String s = \"hello\";\n        String p = \"h*ello\";\n        assertTrue(isMatch(s, p));\n    }\n}\n```\nWith these changes, the compiler should be able to find the `Practice` class and you should no longer see any errors."}
