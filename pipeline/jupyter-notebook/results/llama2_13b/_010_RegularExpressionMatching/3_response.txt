 The error is caused by the fact that the method `isMatch` is defined as a `boolean` return type, but it does not return anything. In Java, methods must return a value of a specific type (in this case, `boolean`) or throw an exception. To fix the error, you should add a return statement with a value of type `boolean`.

Here's the corrected code:
```
public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {
    // ...
    return true; // or false if the match fails
}
```
