{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 89, "response": " The error message indicates that the Java compiler is expecting a class, interface, or enum, but it is not finding one in the code. Specifically, it is looking for a class or interface called \"Practice\" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`.\n\nThe code provided does not define any classes or interfaces, so the compiler is throwing an error. To fix the issue, you need to define a class or interface called \"Practice\" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`.\n\nHere is an example of how you can define a class called \"Practice\" in the file `/app/leetcode-master/src/_010_RegularExpressionMatching/Practice.java`:\n```\npublic class Practice {\n    public boolean isMatch(String s, String p) {\n        // Implement the regular expression matching logic here\n        return true; // or false if the match fails\n    }\n}\n```"}
