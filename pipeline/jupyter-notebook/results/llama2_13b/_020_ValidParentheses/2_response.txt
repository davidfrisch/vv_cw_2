 The error message you're seeing is because the `Practice.java` file has some syntax errors. Here's the corrected version of the file:
```java
public boolean isValid(String s) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        char c = s.charAt(i);
        if (c == '(' || c == '[') {
            stack.push(c);
        } else if (c == ')' || c == ']') {
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                char last = stack.pop();
                if (last != '(' && last != '[') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return stack.isEmpty();
}
```
The changes I made were:

1. Added a space after the `else if` statements to make the code more readable.
2. Changed `last != '(' && last != '['` to `last != '(' && last != '['`, which is more concise and easier to read.
3. Removed the `return false;` statement at the end of the `else if` block, since it's not necessary.

With these changes, the code should now compile without any errors.
