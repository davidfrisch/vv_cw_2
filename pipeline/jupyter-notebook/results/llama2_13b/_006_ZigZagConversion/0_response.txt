 Sure! Here's the complete solution code:

package _006_ZigZagConversion;

import java.util.Stack;

public class Practice {

    public String convert(String a, int b) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
            char c = a.charAt(i);
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                stack.push(c);
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        String result = "";
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            result += stack.pop();
        }
        return result;
    }

}

Here's an explanation of the solution:

1. We use a Stack to store the characters of the input string.
2. We iterate through the input string, and for each character, we check if the current index is even or odd.
3. If the index is even, we push the character onto the stack.
4. If the index is odd, we pop the top character from the stack, and then push the current character onto the stack.
5. After iterating through the entire input string, we use the stack to construct the zigzag pattern. We do this by taking the characters off the stack and concatenating them into a new string.
6. Finally, we return the zigzag pattern as the result of the function.
