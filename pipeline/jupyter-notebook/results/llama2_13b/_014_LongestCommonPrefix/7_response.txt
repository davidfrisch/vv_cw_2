 Sure! Here is the complete Java code:

public class Practice {
    public static String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        int n = strs.length;
        if (n == 0) {
            return "";
        }

        String prefix = strs[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefix = prefix.commonPrefix(strs[i]);
        }

        return prefix;
    }
}

The error you were seeing was because there was no Java code block in the given response. This complete code should fix the issue.
