 Here is the complete solution code for the problem "Longest Common Prefix" on LeetCode:

package _014_LongestCommonPrefix;

public class Practice {

    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        // Use a hash set to keep track of the characters that have already been seen.
        HashSet<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // Initialize an empty string to store the longest common prefix.
        String longestPrefix = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < strs.length; i++) {
            String str = strs[i];

            // Iterate through each character in the string.
            for (int j = 0; j < str.length(); j++) {
                char c = str.charAt(j);

                // If we haven't seen this character before, add it to the set of seen characters.
                if (!seen.contains(c)) {
                    seen.add(c);
                }
            }
        }

        return longestPrefix;
    }
}

Note that this solution has a time complexity of O(N) and a space complexity of O(N), where N is the length of the input array of strings. It works by using a hash set to keep track of the characters that have already been seen, and then iterating through each string in the input array to find the longest common prefix.
