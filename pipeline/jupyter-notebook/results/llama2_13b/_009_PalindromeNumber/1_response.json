{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 60, "response": " Sure! Here's the complete Java code with the fix:\n```\npackage _009_PalindromeNumber;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {\n        if (x < 0) return false;\n        String str = String.valueOf(x);\n        int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1;\n        while (left <= right) {\n            if (str.charAt(left++) != str.charAt(right--)) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n        return true;\n    }\n}\n```\nThe issue was that the code had a method stub instead of a complete implementation. The fix is to provide a complete implementation of the `isPalindrome` method, which checks if an integer is a palindrome by converting it to a string and then checking if the string is the same when reversed."}
