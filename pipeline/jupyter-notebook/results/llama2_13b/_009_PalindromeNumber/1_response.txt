 Sure! Here's the complete Java code with the fix:
```
package _009_PalindromeNumber;

public class Practice {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return false;
        String str = String.valueOf(x);
        int left = 0, right = str.length() - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (str.charAt(left++) != str.charAt(right--)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
The issue was that the code had a method stub instead of a complete implementation. The fix is to provide a complete implementation of the `isPalindrome` method, which checks if an integer is a palindrome by converting it to a string and then checking if the string is the same when reversed.
