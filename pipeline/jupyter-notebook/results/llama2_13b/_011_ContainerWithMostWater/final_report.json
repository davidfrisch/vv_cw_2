Here's the complete solution code for the \"Container With Most Water\" problem:\n\npackage _011_ContainerWithMostWater;\n\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Practice {\n\n    public int maxArea(int[] height) {\n        // Sort the array in descending order\n        Arrays.sort(height, Collections.reverseOrder());\n\n        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;\n        int maxArea = 0;\n\n        while (left < right) {\n            int currentArea = Math.min(height[right], height[left]) * (right - left);\n            maxArea = Math.max(currentArea, maxArea);\n\n            // Move the left pointer to the next point where the current area is maximized\n            while (height[left] <= height[right]) {\n                left++;\n            }\n\n            // Move the right pointer to the next point where the current area is maximized\n            while (height[right] <= height[left]) {\n                right--;\n            }\n        }\n\n        return maxArea;\n    }\n}\n\nNote that this solution uses two pointers approach to find the maximum area. The left pointer moves towards the right until it reaches a point where the current area is maximized, and then it moves back to the previous point. Similarly, the right pointer moves towards the left until it reaches a point where the current area is maximized, and then it moves back to the previous point. The maximum area is found by comparing the minimum height of the two pointers with the height of the points between them.",

The left pointer moves towards the right pointer, and the right pointer moves towards the left pointer, until they meet at the midpoint of the array. Then, they move backwards, comparing the heights of the elements at each position, and updating the maxArea variable accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this is just one possible solution to this problem, and there may be other ways to solve it as well.",
