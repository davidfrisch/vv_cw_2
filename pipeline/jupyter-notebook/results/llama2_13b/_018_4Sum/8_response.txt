 The error message indicates that there are several issues with the code:

1. The class "FourSum" should be declared in a file named FourSum.java, not in the Practice.java file.
2. The symbol "List" is not defined in the current scope. It should be imported from the java.util package.
3. The constructor "ArrayList()" is not defined in the current scope. It should be imported from the java.util package.
4. The method "add" is not defined in the current scope. It should be imported from the java.util package.
5. The variable "result" is not initialized before it is used.
6. The method "fourSum" should return a List<List<Integer>>, not a List<Integer>.
7. The parameter "nums" is not used in the current scope.
8. The parameter "target" is not used in the current scope.

Here's the corrected code:

public class FourSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
                    list.add(nums[i]);
                    list.add(nums[j]);
                    result.add(list);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

Note that the code is now in a separate file named FourSum.java, as recommended by the error message.
