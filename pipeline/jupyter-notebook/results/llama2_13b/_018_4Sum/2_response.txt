 The error message you're seeing is because the `Practice.java` file contains a class with the same name as the package, which is not allowed in Java. To fix this, you should rename the class to something else.

Here's the corrected version of the `Practice.java` file:
```
public class FourSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
Note that I've also removed the `public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(` line, as it's not necessary to specify the return type of the method in the method declaration.
