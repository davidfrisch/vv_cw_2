{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 86, "response": " Sure! Here is the corrected Java code for the `FourSum` class:\n```\npublic class FourSum {\n    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();\n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {\n                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {\n                    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();\n                    list.add(nums[i]);\n                    list.add(nums[j]);\n                    result.add(list);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\nThe errors you were seeing were due to the fact that the `List` class is not a valid type in Java. Instead, you need to use the `ArrayList` class, which is a collection of integers that can be added to and manipulated.\n\nAdditionally, I've added a `return result;` statement at the end of the method to return the resulting list of lists.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}
