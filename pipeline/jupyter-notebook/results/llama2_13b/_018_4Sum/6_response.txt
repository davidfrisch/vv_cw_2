The error is that the class "FourSum" is already defined in the file "Practice.java", and it should be declared in a separate file named "FourSum.java". Here is the corrected version of the code:
```
public class FourSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
