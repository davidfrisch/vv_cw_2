 The error message is indicating that the `FourSum` class is defined in the `Practice.java` file, but it should be defined in a file named `FourSum.java`. Additionally, the `List` class is not being imported or declared in the `Practice.java` file, so the compiler is unable to find it.

To fix this error, you should create a new file named `FourSum.java` and define the `FourSum` class there. You should also import the `List` class from the `java.util` package:
```
import java.util.List;

public class FourSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
This will fix the compilation error and allow you to run the LeetCode challenge without any issues.
