{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 91, "response": " The error message is indicating that the `FourSum` class is defined in the `Practice.java` file, but it should be defined in a file named `FourSum.java`. Additionally, the `List` class is not being imported or declared in the `Practice.java` file, so the compiler is unable to find it.\n\nTo fix this error, you should create a new file named `FourSum.java` and define the `FourSum` class there. You should also import the `List` class from the `java.util` package:\n```\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class FourSum {\n    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis will fix the compilation error and allow you to run the LeetCode challenge without any issues."}
