 Sure! Here is the corrected Java code for the `FourSum` class:
```
public class FourSum {
    public List<List<Integer>> fourSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
                    list.add(nums[i]);
                    list.add(nums[j]);
                    result.add(list);
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
The errors you were seeing were due to the fact that the `List` class is not a valid type in Java. Instead, you need to use the `ArrayList` class, which is a collection of integers that can be added to and manipulated.

Additionally, I've added a `return result;` statement at the end of the method to return the resulting list of lists.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
