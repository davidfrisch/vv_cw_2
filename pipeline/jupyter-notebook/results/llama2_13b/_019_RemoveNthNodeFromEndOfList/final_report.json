            "response": "Here is the complete solution code for the \"Remove Nth Node from End of List\" problem:\n\npackage _019_RemoveNthNodeFromEndOfList;\n\nimport com.leetcode.ListNode;\n\nclass Solution {\n    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\n        if (n == 0) {\n            return head;\n        }\n        ListNode slow = head;\n        ListNode fast = head;\n        int count = 1;\n        while (fast.next != null && count < n) {\n            slow = slow.next;\n            count++;\n        }\n        if (count == n) {\n            slow.next = fast.next;\n            return head;\n        } else {\n            slow.next = fast.next;\n            fast = slow.next;\n        }\n        return head;\n    }\n}\n\nThis solution uses two pointers, a \"slow\" pointer and a \"fast\" pointer, to traverse the linked list. The \"slow\" pointer moves one node at a time, while the \"fast\" pointer moves n nodes at a time. When the \"fast\" pointer reaches the end of the list, it jumps back to the beginning of the list and starts moving one node at a time again. This continues until the \"count\" variable equals \"n\", at which point the \"slow\" pointer is positioned at the node that should be removed, and the \"fast\" pointer is positioned at the next node after the one that should be removed. The \"slow\" pointer is then assigned to the \"fast\" pointer's next node, effectively removing the nth node from the end of the list.\n\nNote that this solution assumes that the input linked list is not null and has at least one node. Also, the solution does not check for errors such as trying to remove a node that does not exist in the list.",

            "response": " Sure! Here is the Java code for the `removeNthFromEnd` method:\n\n```\npublic ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\n    if (head == null || n < 1) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    ListNode current = head;\n    int i = 1;\n\n    while (i < n && current != null) {\n        current = current.next;\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    if (current != null) {\n        current.next = current.next.next;\n    }\n\n    return head;\n}\n```\nThis method uses two pointers to find the nth node from the end of the list and remove it. The `current` pointer points to the current node, and the `i` variable keeps track of the index of the current node. The method checks for the edge cases of `head` being null or `n` being less than 1, and returns `null` in those cases. Otherwise, it loops through the list until it finds the `n`th node from the end, and then updates the link between the `n`th node and its successor to remove the `n`th node from the list. Finally, the method returns the head of the updated list.",
