Here is the Java code for the `removeNthFromEnd` method:\n\n```\npublic ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {\n    if (head == null || n < 1) {\n        return null;\n    }\n\n    ListNode current = head;\n    int i = 1;\n\n    while (i < n && current != null) {\n        current = current.next;\n        i++;\n    }\n\n    if (current != null) {\n        current.next = current.next.next;\n    }\n\n    return head;\n}\n```\nThis method uses two pointers to find the nth node from the end of the list and remove it. The `current` pointer points to the current node, and the `i` variable keeps track of the index of the current node. The method checks for the edge cases of `head` being null or `n` being less than 1, and returns `null` in those cases. Otherwise, it loops through the list until it finds the `n`th node from the end, and then updates the link between the `n`th node and its successor to remove the `n`th node from the list. Finally, the method returns the head of the updated list."}
