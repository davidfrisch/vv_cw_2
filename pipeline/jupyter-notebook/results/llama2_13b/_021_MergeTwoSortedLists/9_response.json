{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 87, "response": " The error message you're seeing is caused by the fact that the `ListNode` class is defined twice in your codebase, once in the `com/leetcode/ListNode.java` file and again in the `src/_021_MergeTwoSortedLists/Practice.java` file. This is causing the compiler to get confused and throw an error.\n\nTo fix this issue, you should remove the definition of `ListNode` from the `src/_021_MergeTwoSortedLists/Practice.java` file, as it is already defined in the `com/leetcode/ListNode.java` file.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the `Practice` class:\n```\npublic class Practice {\n    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode node11, ListNode node21) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\nThis should fix the error and allow you to compile your code without any issues."}
