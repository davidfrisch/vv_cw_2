 The error message you're seeing is caused by the fact that the `ListNode` class is defined twice in your codebase, once in the `com/leetcode/ListNode.java` file and again in the `src/_021_MergeTwoSortedLists/Practice.java` file. This is causing the compiler to get confused and throw an error.

To fix this issue, you should remove the definition of `ListNode` from the `src/_021_MergeTwoSortedLists/Practice.java` file, as it is already defined in the `com/leetcode/ListNode.java` file.

Here's the corrected version of the `Practice` class:
```
public class Practice {
    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode node11, ListNode node21) {
        // ...
    }
}
```
This should fix the error and allow you to compile your code without any issues.
