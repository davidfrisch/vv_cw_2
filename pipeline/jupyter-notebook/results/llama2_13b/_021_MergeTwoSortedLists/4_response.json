{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 170, "response": " The error message you're seeing is caused by a duplicate class definition in your code. Specifically, there is a file called `ListNode.java` in your source directory that contains a class with the same name as the inner class of the `Practice` class. This is not allowed in Java, as classes can only extend other classes, not define the same name.\n\nTo fix this error, you will need to remove the `ListNode.java` file from your source directory or rename it to a different name. Additionally, you will need to update the `Practice.java` file to reflect the changed name of the inner class.\n\nHere is an example of how you can fix the error:\n\n1. Remove the `ListNode.java` file from your source directory.\n2. Rename the inner class of the `Practice` class to a different name, such as `MyListNode`.\n3. Update the `Practice.java` file to reflect the changed name of the inner class:\n```\npublic class Practice {\n    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode node11, ListNode node21) {\n        // ...\n    }\n}\n```\n4. Compile the code again to ensure that there are no more errors.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}
