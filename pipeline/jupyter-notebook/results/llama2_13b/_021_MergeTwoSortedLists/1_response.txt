 Here is the corrected Java code for the given problem:

 package _021_MergeTwoSortedLists;

 import com.leetcode.ListNode;

 public class Practice {

     public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode node1, ListNode node2) {
         ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
         ListNode current = dummy;

         while (node1 != null && node2 != null) {
             if (node1.val <= node2.val) {
                 current.next = node1;
                 node1 = node1.next;
             } else {
                 current.next = node2;
                 node2 = node2.next;
             }
             current = current.next;
         }

         if (node1 != null) {
             current.next = node1;
         } else {
             current.next = node2;
         }

         return dummy.next;
     }

 }

Note that the method name has been changed from "mergeTwoLists" to "mergeTwoLists(ListNode, ListNode)" and the parameters have been renamed accordingly. Additionally, the code has been corrected to use ListNode objects instead of integers to represent the nodes of the linked lists.
