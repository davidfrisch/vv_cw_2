Here is the complete Java code for the `reverse` method:\n\n```\npackage _007_ReverseInteger;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public int reverse(int a) {\n        if (a == 0) {\n            return 0;\n        }\n        int rev = 0;\n        while (a != 0) {\n            int rem = a % 10;\n            rev *= 10;\n            rev += rem;\n            a /= 10;\n        }\n        return rev;\n    }\n}\n```\nThis code uses a while loop to reverse the digits of the input integer. It first checks if the input is 0, in which case the output should also be 0. Then it uses a while loop to iterate over the digits of the input, using the modulo operator `%` to extract each digit and the multiplication operator `*` to combine the digits into a single result. Finally, it returns the resulting integer.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance."}
