 Sure! Here is the complete Java code for the `reverse` method:

```
package _007_ReverseInteger;

public class Practice {
    public int reverse(int a) {
        if (a == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int rev = 0;
        while (a != 0) {
            int rem = a % 10;
            rev *= 10;
            rev += rem;
            a /= 10;
        }
        return rev;
    }
}
```
This code uses a while loop to reverse the digits of the input integer. It first checks if the input is 0, in which case the output should also be 0. Then it uses a while loop to iterate over the digits of the input, using the modulo operator `%` to extract each digit and the multiplication operator `*` to combine the digits into a single result. Finally, it returns the resulting integer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
