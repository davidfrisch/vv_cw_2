 Here is the complete solution code for the "Reverse Integer" problem on LeetCode:

package _007_ReverseInteger;

import static java.lang.Math.abs;

public class Practice {

    public int reverse(int a) {
        int sign = (a > 0) ? 1 : -1;
        long temp = abs(a);
        long rev = 0;

        while (temp != 0) {
            rev = (rev * 10) + (temp % 10);
            temp /= 10;
        }

        return (int) rev * sign;
    }

}

Note that this solution uses long variables to store the reversed integer, as it can overflow a 32-bit signed integer. The sign of the input is also handled correctly.
