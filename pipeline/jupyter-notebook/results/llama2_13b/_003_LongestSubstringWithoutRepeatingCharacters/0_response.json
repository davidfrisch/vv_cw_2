We initialize a hash set to keep track of the characters in the string. This allows us to quickly check if a character has already been seen.\n2. We initialize two pointers, one pointing to the beginning of the string and the other pointing to the end of the string.\n3. We loop until the right pointer reaches the end of the string.\n4. For each character, we check if it is in the seen set. If it is not, we mark it as seen and increase the left pointer. This allows us to find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n5. After looping through the entire string, we return the length of the longest substring without repeating characters, which is the distance between the beginning and end pointers.\n\nI hope this helps!
