{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 83, "response": " Sure, here is the complete Java code for the `lengthOfLongestSubstring` method:\n\n```\npublic int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String a) {\n    int len = 0;\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {\n        char curr = a.charAt(i);\n\n        if (left == right) {\n            // If the current character is the same as the last character in the substring,\n            // then we can move the right pointer forward.\n            right++;\n        } else {\n            // Otherwise, we need to check if the current character is the same as the last character\n            // in the substring. If it is not, then we need to reset the right pointer to 0.\n            right = 0;\n        }\n\n        // Update the left pointer to move to the next character in the string.\n        left++;\n    }\n\n    return len;\n}\n```\nThis method uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to keep track of the positions of the substring. The `left` pointer moves forward as we iterate through the string, and the `right` pointer moves forward only when we encounter a character that is not the same as the last character in the substring. At the end of the loop, the `right` pointer will be at the position of the longest substring without repeating characters."}
