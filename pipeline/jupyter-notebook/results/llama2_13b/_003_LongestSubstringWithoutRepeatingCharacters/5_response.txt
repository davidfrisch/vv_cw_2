 The error is caused by the fact that the `Practice.java` file contains multiple class definitions, which is not allowed in Java. Each class definition should be in its own file.

Here is the corrected code:
```
public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String a) {
    int len = 0;
    int left = 0;
    int right = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
        char curr = a.charAt(i);

        if (right == 0 || curr != a.charAt(right - 1)) {
            right = 0;
        }

        left++;
    }

    return len;
}
```
You should move the `Practice.java` file to a new file named `Practice.class`, and then you can compile and run the program without any errors.
