{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 57, "response": " The error is caused by the fact that the `Practice.java` file contains multiple class definitions, which is not allowed in Java. Each class definition should be in its own file.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n```\npublic int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String a) {\n    int len = 0;\n    int left = 0;\n    int right = 0;\n\n    for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {\n        char curr = a.charAt(i);\n\n        if (right == 0 || curr != a.charAt(right - 1)) {\n            right = 0;\n        }\n\n        left++;\n    }\n\n    return len;\n}\n```\nYou should move the `Practice.java` file to a new file named `Practice.class`, and then you can compile and run the program without any errors."}
