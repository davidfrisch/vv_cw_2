 Sure! Here's the corrected code:

public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String a) {
int len = 0;
int left = 0;
int right = 0;

for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {
    char curr = a.charAt(i);

    if (right == 0 || curr != a.charAt(right - 1)) {
        right = 0;
    }

    left++;
}

return len;
}

The errors were caused by the fact that the code was trying to use a `String` as a variable, which is not allowed in Java. By changing the variable names to `char`, the code should now compile without any issues.
