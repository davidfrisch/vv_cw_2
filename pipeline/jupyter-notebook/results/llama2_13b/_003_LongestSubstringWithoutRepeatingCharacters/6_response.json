Here's the corrected code:\n\npublic int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String a) {\nint len = 0;\nint left = 0;\nint right = 0;\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++) {\n    char curr = a.charAt(i);\n\n    if (right == 0 || curr != a.charAt(right - 1)) {\n        right = 0;\n    }\n\n    left++;\n}\n\nreturn len;\n}\n\nThe errors were caused by the fact that the code was trying to use a `String` as a variable, which is not allowed in Java. By changing the variable names to `char`, the code should now compile without any issues."}
