 The error is caused by the fact that the `case` statements in the `switch` statement are not properly formatted. Each `case` statement should be on a separate line, and the `default` statement should also be on a separate line.

Here is the corrected code:
```
public String intToRoman(int a) {
    switch (a) {
        case 1: return "I";
        case 2: return "II";
        case 3: return "III";
        case 4: return "IV";
        case 5: return "V";
        case 6: return "VI";
        case 7: return "VII";
        case 8: return "VIII";
        case 9: return "IX";
        default:
            return String.valueOf(a);
    }
}
```
This should fix the error and allow the code to compile successfully.
