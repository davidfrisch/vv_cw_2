Here's the fixed Java code for the `intToRoman` method:\n\npublic String intToRoman(int a) {\n    switch (a) {\n        case 1: return \"I\";\n        case 2: return \"II\";\n        case 3: return \"III\";\n        case 4: return \"IV\";\n        case 5: return \"V\";\n        case 6: return \"VI\";\n        case 7: return \"VII\";\n        case 8: return \"VIII\";\n        case 9: return \"IX\";\n        default: return String.valueOf(a);\n    }\n}\n\nThe errors were caused by the fact that the `case` statements were not properly indented, and the default case was not correctly formatted. The fixed code corrects these issues and should now compile without any errors."}
