{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 61, "response": " Sure, I can help you with that! The error message you're seeing is because the `Practice` class is not defined in the file `PracticeTest.java`. To fix this, you need to add the definition of the `Practice` class above the `PracticeTest` class. Here's the corrected version of the file:\n```\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    // Define the practice method here\n}\n\npublic class PracticeTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        // Test the practice method here\n    }\n}\n```\nWith this correction, you should be able to compile the code without any errors."}
