 Sure, I can help you with that! The error message you're seeing is because the `Practice` class is not defined in the file `PracticeTest.java`. To fix this, you need to add the definition of the `Practice` class above the `PracticeTest` class. Here's the corrected version of the file:
```
import java.util.List;

public class Practice {
    // Define the practice method here
}

public class PracticeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the practice method here
    }
}
```
With this correction, you should be able to compile the code without any errors.
