 It looks like there is an indentation issue in your Java code causing a syntax error. Here is the corrected version:

```java
boolean[][] dp; // Declare without initializing

// ... other code ...

if (m > 0 && n > 0) {
    dp = new boolean[m + 1][n + 1]; // Initialize with correct dimensions
}
```

Make sure that your `if` statement is only executed when `m` and `n` have been defined, otherwise you will get a compilation error.
