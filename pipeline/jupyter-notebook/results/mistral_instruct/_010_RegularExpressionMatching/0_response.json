The base case is when the pattern is empty and the string is empty, which is true. For other cases, it checks if the current character in the pattern matches the corresponding character in the string, or if the current character in the pattern is a '*'. If the current character in the pattern is a '*', then it considers two possibilities: greedy approach and lazy approach. Finally, it returns the result from the last subproblem (the entire input strings)."}
