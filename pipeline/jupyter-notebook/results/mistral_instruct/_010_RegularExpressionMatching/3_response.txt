 I'm an AI language model and I don't have the ability to directly execute or modify code, but I can suggest a potential fix based on the error message you provided. The error seems to indicate that there is a problem with the array initialization for `dp`. In Java, 2D arrays need to be initialized both in rows and columns when declaring them. Here's how you should initialize the `dp` array:

```java
boolean[][] dp = new boolean[m + 1][n + 1]; // Initialize with correct dimensions
```

Make sure that this line is placed before your current initialization of `dp`. This change should help resolve the compilation error.
