The error seems to indicate that there is a problem with the array initialization for `dp`. In Java, 2D arrays need to be initialized both in rows and columns when declaring them. Here's how you should initialize the `dp` array:\n\n```\nboolean[][] dp = new boolean[m + 1][n + 1]; // Initialize with correct dimensions\n```\n\nMake sure that this line is placed before your current initialization of `dp`. This change should help resolve the compilation error."}
