Initialize the dp array with a size of (m+1) x (n+1), where m is the length of the string and n is the length of the pattern.\n2. In the for loop for i, initialize j from 0 instead of 1 as an empty pattern matches an empty string by default.\n3. Change dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]; in the first iteration of the inner for loop to handle the case when the current character in the pattern is not present.\n4. Correct the index for accessing dp[m][n].\n5. Add a check for j > 0 in the first if statement inside the inner for loop to ensure that we don't consider empty string matches with non-empty patterns before considering the other cases.\n6. Change the condition of the second if statement inside the inner for loop to dp[i - 1][j - 1] instead of dp[i - 1][j]. This fixes the issue where the first character in the string is being compared with an empty pattern or a non-empty pattern without considering the preceding character.\n7. Change the condition of the last if statement inside the inner for loop to dp[k + 1][j] instead of dp[k][j]. This fixes the index out of bounds error in the lazy approach."}
