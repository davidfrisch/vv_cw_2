 The error is caused by an incorrect type in the assignment of `list` in the line `List<Integer> list = map.get(sum);`. It should be `List<Integer> list = map.get(sum) == null ? new ArrayList<>() : map.get(sum);`, or use a generic Map like `Map<Integer, List<Integer>> map` to ensure the value is a List. The rest of the code seems correct. However, this code uses a lot of memory and can be slow for large input sizes due to creating many lists and maps. Consider optimizing it using hash sets instead.
