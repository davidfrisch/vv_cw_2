You should add an import statement at the beginning of your test file to import the Practice class. Here's how it should look:\n\n```\nimport static org.junit.Assert.*;\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\npublic class PracticeTest {\n    @Test\n    public void testLongestPalindrome() {\n        Practice solution = new Practice();\n        assertEquals(\"racecar\", solution.longestPalindrome(\"racecar\"));\n        // Add more test cases here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou should also ensure that the Practice.java file is in the same package as the PracticeTest.java file or provide the full path to the Practice.java file if it's located in a different package."}
