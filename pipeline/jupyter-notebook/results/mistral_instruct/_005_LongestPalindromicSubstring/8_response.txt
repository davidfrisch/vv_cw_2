 The error is occurring because the file named "Practice.java" contains a public class named "PracticeTest" instead of "Practice". You need to rename your main class file to "Practice.java" and move all the code inside it to a new file named "PracticeTest.java". Here is the corrected Java code:

// In src/_005_LongestPalindromicSubstring/Practice.java

public class Practice {
    // Write your longestPalindrome() method here
}

// In src/_005_LongestPalindromicSubstring/PracticeTest.java

import static org.junit.Assert.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class PracticeTest {
    @Test
    public void testLongestPalindrome() {
        Practice solution = new Practice();
        assertEquals("racecar", solution.longestPalindrome("racecar"));
        // Add more test cases here
    }
}
