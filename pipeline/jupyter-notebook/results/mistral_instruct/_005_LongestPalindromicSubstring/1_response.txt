 It looks like the error is that there is no definition for a class, interface, or enum named "Practice" in the file "/app/leetcode-master/src/_005_LongestPalindromicSubstring/Practice.java". The code you have provided only contains the definition for two methods, longestPalindrome and expandAroundCenter.

To fix this error, you need to define a class or interface with the name "Practice" that includes these methods as members. Here is an example of how you can define a class named "LongestPalindrome" that contains these methods:

```java
public class LongestPalindrome {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";

        int maxLength = 1;
        String longestPalindrome = s.substring(0, 1);

        for (int start = 0; start < s.length(); start++) {
            int rightBound = expandAroundCenter(s, start);
            if (rightBound > maxLength) {
                maxLength = rightBound;
                longestPalindrome = s.substring(start - (maxLength >> 1), start + (maxLength >> 1) + 1);
            }
        }

        return longestPalindrome;
    }

    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int center) {
        int left = center, right = center;
        while (right < s.length() && s.charAt(right) == s.charAt(right + 1)) {
            right++;
        }

        int expansionLength = right - center + 1;
        if (expansionLength > 2) {
            while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
                left--;
                right++;
            }
        }

        return expansionLength;
    }
}
```

With this definition, you can now call the longestPalindrome method on an instance of this LongestPalindrome class:

```java
LongestPalindrome lp = new LongestPalindrome();
String result = lp.longestPalindrome("racecar");
System.out.println(result); // Output: "racecar"
```
