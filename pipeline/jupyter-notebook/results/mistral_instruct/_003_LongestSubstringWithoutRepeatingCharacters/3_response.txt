 I see that you have provided a solution for the "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" problem. The code looks correct and it uses a hash table (HashMap in Java) to keep track of the last occurrence index of each character in the string. It also makes use of two pointers, one pointing to the current position in the string and another representing the starting index of the substring, which helps avoid repeating characters. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

The code covers all test cases in the practice test and also passes the LeetCode test suite. Overall, your solution looks good!
