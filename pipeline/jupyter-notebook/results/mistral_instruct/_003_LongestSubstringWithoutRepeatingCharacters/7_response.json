We first check if the input string is empty or its length is 1, in which case we simply return its length.\n2. We create a `HashMap<Character, Integer>` named `charMap` to store the last occurrence index of each character in the current substring.\n3. We also initialize two variables `maxLen` and `start` to keep track of the length and starting index of the longest substring without repeating characters respectively.\n4. In the for loop, we iterate through all characters in the input string `s`. For each character, we first check if it already exists in the current substring using the `charMap`. If it does and its last occurrence index is less than or equal to the starting index of the current substring (i.e., `start`), then we need to move the starting index forward by 1 to exclude the previous substring with repeating characters.\n5. If the character doesn't exist in the current substring, then we update `maxLen` with the maximum length between it and the length of the substring between `start` and the current index `i`. We also add this character and its index to the `charMap`.\n6. After the for loop completes, we return the maximum length found."}
