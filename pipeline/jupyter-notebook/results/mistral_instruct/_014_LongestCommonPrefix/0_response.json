Arrays;\n\n/** see test {@link _014_LongestCommonPrefix.PracticeTest} */\npublic class Practice {\n\n    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {\n        if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) {\n            return \"\";\n        }\n\n        String prefix = strs[0];\n        \n        for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {\n            while (!strs[i].startsWith(prefix)) {\n                if (prefix.isEmpty()) {\n                    return \"\";\n                }\n                prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length() - 1);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return prefix;\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThis solution uses a simple approach where it initializes the `prefix` variable with the first string in the input array, and then checks each subsequent string to see if it starts with the current prefix. If any string doesn't start with the prefix, the prefix is updated by removing the last character until it matches the common prefix of all strings in the array.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the input array, since we need to check each string once and possibly remove one character from the prefix for each string. The space complexity is also O(N), as we store the entire input array in memory and the prefix variable, which can be up to N characters long."}
