 Here is the corrected Java code for the `Test3` method:

```java
@Test
public void Test3() {
    String A = "AB";
    int B = 2;
    String actual = solution.zigZagConversion(A, B); // Assuming your class name is "solution" and the method name is "zigZagConversion"
    String expected = "ZB"; // Adjust as needed based on the expected output for given input A and B
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}
```

Make sure to replace `solution` and `zigZagConversion` with the actual name of your class and method respectively. Also, adjust the expected string value accordingly based on the expected outcome for the provided inputs.
