{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 62, "response": " It looks like there are some issues with your Java file named `Practice.java`. The errors suggest that you're missing a class or interface declaration at the beginning of the file. Here is how the corrected `Practice.java` should look:\n\n```\npublic class Practice {\n\n    @Test\n    public void Test3() {\n        String A = \"AB\";\n        int B = 2;\n        String actual = solution.zigZagConversion(A, B); // Assuming your class name is \"solution\" and the method name is \"zigZagConversion\"\n        String expected = \"ZB\"; // Adjust as needed based on the expected output for given input A and B\n        assertEquals(expected, actual);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure your `Practice.java` file starts with a class declaration (`public class Practice { ... }`) instead of just defining methods in the global scope."}
