 It looks like there are some issues with your Java file named `Practice.java`. The errors suggest that you're missing a class or interface declaration at the beginning of the file. Here is how the corrected `Practice.java` should look:

```java
public class Practice {

    @Test
    public void Test3() {
        String A = "AB";
        int B = 2;
        String actual = solution.zigZagConversion(A, B); // Assuming your class name is "solution" and the method name is "zigZagConversion"
        String expected = "ZB"; // Adjust as needed based on the expected output for given input A and B
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
}
```

Make sure your `Practice.java` file starts with a class declaration (`public class Practice { ... }`) instead of just defining methods in the global scope.
