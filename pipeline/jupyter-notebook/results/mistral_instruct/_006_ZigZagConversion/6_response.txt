 The error is caused by a missing semicolon (;\) at the end of method declaration `public void Test3() {` in your Java code. To fix the issue, add a semicolon at the end of the method declaration as follows:

```java
@Test
public void Test3() {
    String A = "AB";
    int B = 2;
    String actual = solution.convert(A, B);
    String expected = "AB";
    assertEquals(expected, actual);
}
```
