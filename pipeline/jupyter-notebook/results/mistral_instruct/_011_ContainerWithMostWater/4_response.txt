 It looks like the error is due to the fact that you are trying to compile a Java file named "Practice.java" which contains only the implementation of the `maxArea` method without defining a class or interface containing this method.

To fix the error, please wrap your `maxArea` method inside a class or an interface as follows:

```java
public class Practice {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

Or you can create an interface and define the `maxArea` method in it if you prefer:

```java
public interface ContainerWithMostWater {
    public int maxArea(int[] height);
}

public class Practice implements ContainerWithMostWater {
    // Your implementation here
}
```

Once you have made these changes, recompile your code and try running it again.
