 It seems that the error is due to the fact that the code provided is not defining a class or an interface, but instead it is just defining a method named "maxArea" within an unnamed class. Here's the corrected Java code:

```java
public class Practice {

    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);

        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                int temp = left;
                left = right;
                right = temp;
            }

            int currentDifference = right - left;
            int newMaxArea = Math.min(height[left], currentDifference) < height[left] ? height[left] * currentDifference : newMaxArea;

            maxArea = Math.max(newMaxArea, maxArea);
            left++;
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
}
```

I added a class named "Practice" that encloses the "maxArea" method to fix the error.
