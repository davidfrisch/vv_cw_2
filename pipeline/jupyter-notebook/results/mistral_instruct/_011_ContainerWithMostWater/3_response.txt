 Here's the corrected Java code:

```java
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int maxArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);

    while (left < right) {
        int currentHeightLeft = height[left];
        int currentHeightRight = height[right];

        int currentArea = Math.min(currentHeightLeft, currentHeightRight) * (right - left);

        if (currentArea > maxArea) {
            maxArea = currentArea;
        }

        if (currentHeightLeft <= currentHeightRight) {
            ++left;
        } else {
            --right;
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
}
```

In the original code, there were a couple of variables that needed to be declared before being used inside the while loop. By declaring `currentHeightLeft` and `currentHeightRight` at the beginning of the loop, we avoid having multiple Java code blocks in the response.
