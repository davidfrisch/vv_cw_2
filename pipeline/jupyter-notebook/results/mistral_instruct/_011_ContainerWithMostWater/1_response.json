{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 59, "response": " Here's the corrected Java code for the `maxArea` method in the given `Practice` class:\n\n```\npublic int maxArea(int[] height) {\n    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;\n    int maxArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);\n\n    while (left < right) {\n        int currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);\n        if (currentArea > maxArea) {\n            maxArea = currentArea;\n        }\n\n        // Update pointers based on the shorter height to avoid array index out of bounds exception\n        if (height[left] <= height[right]) {\n            ++left;\n        } else {\n            --right;\n        }\n    }\n\n    return maxArea;\n}\n```\n\nThe issue with the original code was that when `height[left]` became greater than `height[right]`, the program tried to decrement the index of the array (`--right`) which would result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. To avoid this, the pointers should be updated based on the shorter height value instead."}
