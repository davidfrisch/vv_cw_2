 Here's the corrected Java code for the `maxArea` method in the given `Practice` class:

```java
public int maxArea(int[] height) {
    int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
    int maxArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);

    while (left < right) {
        int currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
        if (currentArea > maxArea) {
            maxArea = currentArea;
        }

        // Update pointers based on the shorter height to avoid array index out of bounds exception
        if (height[left] <= height[right]) {
            ++left;
        } else {
            --right;
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
}
```

The issue with the original code was that when `height[left]` became greater than `height[right]`, the program tried to decrement the index of the array (`--right`) which would result in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. To avoid this, the pointers should be updated based on the shorter height value instead.
