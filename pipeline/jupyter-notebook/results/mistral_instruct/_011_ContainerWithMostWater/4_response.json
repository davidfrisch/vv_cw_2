{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 2, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": " It looks like the error is due to the fact that you are trying to compile a Java file named \"Practice.java\" which contains only the implementation of the `maxArea` method without defining a class or interface containing this method.\n\nTo fix the error, please wrap your `maxArea` method inside a class or an interface as follows:\n\n```java\npublic class Practice {\n    public int maxArea(int[] height) {\n        // Your implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOr you can create an interface and define the `maxArea` method in it if you prefer:\n\n```java\npublic interface ContainerWithMostWater {\n    public int maxArea(int[] height);\n}\n\npublic class Practice implements ContainerWithMostWater {\n    // Your implementation here\n}\n```\n\nOnce you have made these changes, recompile your code and try running it again."}
