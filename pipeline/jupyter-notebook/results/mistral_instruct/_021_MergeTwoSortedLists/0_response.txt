 Here's the complete file with the solution for merging two sorted linked lists:

```java
package _021_MergeTwoSortedLists;

import com.leetcode.ListNode;

/** see test {@link _021_MergeTwoSortedLists.PracticeTest } */
public class Practice {

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode node1, ListNode node2) {
        if (node1 == null) {
            return node2;
        } else if (node2 == null) {
            return node1;
        }

        if (node1.val <= node2.val) {
            node1.next = mergeTwoLists(node1.next, node2);
            return node1;
        } else {
            node2.next = mergeTwoLists(node1, node2.next);
            return node2;
        }
    }

}
```

This solution iteratively merges the two linked lists by comparing their first nodes and deciding which one should be the head of the merged list based on their values. The method then continues to merge the remaining parts of each list recursively using the `mergeTwoLists` method itself.
