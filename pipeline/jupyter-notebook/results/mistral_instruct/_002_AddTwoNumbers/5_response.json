{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 134, "response": " It looks like you have a compilation error due to having a duplicate definition of the `ListNode` class in your project. In your code snippet above, there is no issue with the `Practice` class, but you should ensure that the `ListNode` class definition exists only in one location within your project directory.\n\nMake sure that the `ListNode` class is located in a proper package under the `src` directory to avoid conflicts, such as placing it under `src/com/leetcode/ListNode.java`. Additionally, you can rename the class definition if you have multiple files with the same name and move the respective file(s) to a different location within your project directory.\n\nHere's an example of how you can structure your package:\n\n```markdown\nsrc/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 com/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 leetcode/\n\u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 ListNode.java\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 Practice.java\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 bin/\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 com/\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 leetcode/\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 Practice.class\n```\n\nMake sure that all your `.java` files are compiled and placed in the appropriate directories for proper compilation of your project."}
