{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 2, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": " It looks like there are illegal characters present in your Java source files. The errors message suggests that there are unrecognized characters such as \"?\" and \"\\u2500\" in the file paths and imports. These characters might have been accidentally included when copying or pasting the code.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to remove these illegal characters from your Java source files. Here's the corrected version of `Practice.java`:\n\n```java\npackage com.leetcode;\n\nimport com.leetcode.ListNode;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    // Your code here\n}\n```\n\nAnd the corrected `ListNode.java` file:\n\n```java\npackage com.leetcode;\n\npublic class ListNode {\n    int val;\n    ListNode next;\n\n    ListNode(int x) {\n        val = x;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to save the files without any unintended characters and rebuild your project. This should resolve the compilation error you encountered."}
