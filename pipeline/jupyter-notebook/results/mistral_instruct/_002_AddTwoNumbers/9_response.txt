 Here's the corrected Java code for the `twoSum` function in your `Practice.java` file:

```java
package com.leetcode;

import com.leetcode.ListNode;

public class Practice {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here to test your solutions against different test cases
    }

    // Solution for problem #1: Two Sum
    public ListNode twoSum(ListNode head, int target) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            if (current.next == null && (prev == null || prev.val + current.val != target)) {
                prev = current;
                current = current.next;
                continue;
            }

            if (current.next != null && prev != null && prev.val + current.val == target) {
                return new ListNode(prev.val, current);
            }

            prev = current;
            current = current.next;
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

In your original code, you were creating a new `ListNode` object with the wrong arguments for its constructor. I changed the condition in the while loop to check if the list has reached the end or not and if `prev` exists, then only create a new node. I also corrected the logic inside the condition where you check for the next node in the list as well.
