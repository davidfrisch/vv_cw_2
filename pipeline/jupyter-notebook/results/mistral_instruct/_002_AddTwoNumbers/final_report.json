We also create a dummy node `current` with a value of -1 to avoid having an empty linked list as the final result. The while loop runs until both lists are exhausted or there's a carry over. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the current digits and the carry, if any. Then, we update the carry and create a new node with the digit value (sum % 10). We link this node to the previous node, and move both pointers ahead. Finally, we return the head of the linked list which is currently stored in the `current` pointer.",

In your `Practice.java` file, you're trying to use `ListNode` as a parameter and as a class name, which is causing the compilation error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either rename the `ListNode` class in one of the files or change the method signature in your `Practice.java` file to accept a different type for the list nodes. For example, you can use `Node` as the node type instead:\n\n```java\npublic class Practice {\n    public Node addTwoNumbers(Node l1, Node l2) {\n        // Your implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure you have defined the `ListNode` (or `Node`) class in a separate file or package.

The error message indicates that there is a file named `ListNode.java` inside the directory `src/com/leetcode/`, which contains the definition of the `ListNode` class, and another file, possibly `Practice.java`, has an import statement for this class but it's located in the wrong directory.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all your source files are placed under their correct directories, so the compiler can correctly locate them. In this case, you should move or copy the `ListNode.java` file from the incorrect location (`src/`) to its correct location (`src/com/leetcode/`).\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.\n2. Use the following command to move or copy the `ListNode.java` file to its correct location (assuming you are using Unix-based systems like Linux or MacOS):\n   ```bash\n   mv src/ListNode.java src/com/leetcode/ListNode.java\n   ```\n3. If you're on Windows, use the following command to copy the `ListNode.java` file:\n   ```cmd\n   move src\\ListNode.java src\\com\\leetcode\\ListNode.java\n   ```\n4. Now, try running your Maven build command again:\n   ```bash\n   mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"YourMainClassName\"\n   ```\n   Replace `YourMainClassName` with the actual name of the class containing your `main()` method in the `src` directory.\n\nBy doing this, you should resolve the duplicate class error and be able to compile your codebase successfully.",

The errors message suggests that there are unrecognized characters such as \"?\" and \"\\u2500\" in the file paths and imports. These characters might have been accidentally included when copying or pasting the code.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to remove these illegal characters from your Java source files. Here's the corrected version of `Practice.java`:\n\n```java\npackage com.leetcode;\n\nimport com.leetcode.ListNode;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    // Your code here\n}\n```\n\nAnd the corrected `ListNode.java` file:\n\n```java\npackage com.leetcode;\n\npublic class ListNode {\n    int val;\n    ListNode next;\n\n    ListNode(int x) {\n        val = x;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to save the files without any unintended characters and rebuild your project. This should resolve the compilation error you encountered.",
