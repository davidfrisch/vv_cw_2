 Here is the corrected Java code for the `Practice.java` file:

```java
package com.leetcode;

import com.leetcode.ListNode;

public class Practice {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code here to test your solutions against different test cases
    }

    // Solution for problem #1: Two Sum
    public ListNode twoSum(ListNode head, int target) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;

        while (current != null) {
            if (current.next == null && prev != null && prev.val + current.val == target) {
                return new ListNode(target, prev);
            }
            prev = current;
            current = current.next;
        }

        return null;
    }
}
```

Make sure that your `ListNode.java` class is defined and placed in the correct location (in the same package as the `Practice.java` file) for this code to compile and run properly.
