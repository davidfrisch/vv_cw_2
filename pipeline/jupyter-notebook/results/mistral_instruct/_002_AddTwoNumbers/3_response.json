{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 3, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": " It seems that you have a duplicate class named \"ListNode\" in your codebase. The error message indicates that there is a file named `ListNode.java` inside the directory `src/com/leetcode/`, which contains the definition of the `ListNode` class, and another file, possibly `Practice.java`, has an import statement for this class but it's located in the wrong directory.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all your source files are placed under their correct directories, so the compiler can correctly locate them. In this case, you should move or copy the `ListNode.java` file from the incorrect location (`src/`) to its correct location (`src/com/leetcode/`).\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.\n2. Use the following command to move or copy the `ListNode.java` file to its correct location (assuming you are using Unix-based systems like Linux or MacOS):\n   ```bash\n   mv src/ListNode.java src/com/leetcode/ListNode.java\n   ```\n3. If you're on Windows, use the following command to copy the `ListNode.java` file:\n   ```cmd\n   move src\\ListNode.java src\\com\\leetcode\\ListNode.java\n   ```\n4. Now, try running your Maven build command again:\n   ```bash\n   mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"YourMainClassName\"\n   ```\n   Replace `YourMainClassName` with the actual name of the class containing your `main()` method in the `src` directory.\n\nBy doing this, you should resolve the duplicate class error and be able to compile your codebase successfully."}
