 It looks like you have a naming conflict with the `ListNode` class being used in multiple files. In your `Practice.java` file, you're trying to use `ListNode` as a parameter and as a class name, which is causing the compilation error.

To resolve this issue, you can either rename the `ListNode` class in one of the files or change the method signature in your `Practice.java` file to accept a different type for the list nodes. For example, you can use `Node` as the node type instead:

```java
public class Practice {
    public Node addTwoNumbers(Node l1, Node l2) {
        // Your implementation here
    }
}
```

Also, make sure you have defined the `ListNode` (or `Node`) class in a separate file or package. For example, you can create a new file named `ListNode.java` with the following content:

```java
public class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

Now, your `Practice.java` file should be able to compile without any issues.
