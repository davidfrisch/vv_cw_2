We also create a dummy node `current` with a value of -1 to avoid having an empty linked list as the final result. The while loop runs until both lists are exhausted or there's a carry over. Inside the loop, we calculate the sum of the current digits and the carry, if any. Then, we update the carry and create a new node with the digit value (sum % 10). We link this node to the previous node, and move both pointers ahead. Finally, we return the head of the linked list which is currently stored in the `current` pointer."}
