{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 2, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": " It looks like you have a naming conflict with the `ListNode` class being used in multiple files. In your `Practice.java` file, you're trying to use `ListNode` as a parameter and as a class name, which is causing the compilation error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either rename the `ListNode` class in one of the files or change the method signature in your `Practice.java` file to accept a different type for the list nodes. For example, you can use `Node` as the node type instead:\n\n```java\npublic class Practice {\n    public Node addTwoNumbers(Node l1, Node l2) {\n        // Your implementation here\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAlso, make sure you have defined the `ListNode` (or `Node`) class in a separate file or package. For example, you can create a new file named `ListNode.java` with the following content:\n\n```java\npublic class ListNode {\n    int val;\n    ListNode next;\n    ListNode(int val) {\n        this.val = val;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNow, your `Practice.java` file should be able to compile without any issues."}
