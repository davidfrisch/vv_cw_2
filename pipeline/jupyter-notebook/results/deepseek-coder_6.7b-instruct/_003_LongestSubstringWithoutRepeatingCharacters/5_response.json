It implements a sliding window approach with two pointers to keep track of the longest substring without repeating characters that contains at most `k` distinct characters. The map `map` keeps track of the count of each character in the current window. If the size of the map exceeds `k`, it means we have more than `k` distinct characters and we need to slide the left pointer to shrink the window.\n"}
