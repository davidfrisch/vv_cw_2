The code you provided appears to be correctly written in Java and should work as expected given that `k` is the maximum number of distinct characters allowed and `s` is the string on which we are finding the longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters. The error message "No Java code block found in the given response" suggests that there's no specific problem or error mentioned in your question, so this might be a misunderstanding of what you need. 

However, if the provided solution doesn't solve the problem or produce expected result, please provide more details about it (e.g., the input and output examples). This will help me to give you a better solution. 

If you are facing any specific error then kindly specify that as well for further assistance.
