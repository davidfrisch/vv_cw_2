It seems like the issue is related to JUnit assertion, not with your mergeTwoLists method itself. The error you're seeing usually occurs when an assert statement fails. 

However, in this case, it appears that `ListNode.isSameList(actual, expected)` might be returning false because of null values in the linked lists which are being compared. 

So, if actual and expected lists have different sizes or any element at a particular position doesn't match, JUnit assertTrue would fail. Please ensure that both your `mergeTwoLists()` method implementation and test cases cover all possible scenarios where you might get null values in the linked list (including edge cases).

Here is how you could write a helper function to compare two Linked Lists:

```java
public static boolean isSameList(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
    while(l1 != null && l2 != null){
        if(l1.val != l2.val){
            return false;
        }
        l1 = l1.next;
        l2 = l2.next;
    }
    
    // If any of the list is not null, they are different
    return (l1 == null && l2 == null);
}
``` 
This function will compare each node's value until it encounters a null pointer in either list, at which point it returns true if both lists were also null. If any of the lists is not null but the other one is, then they are different and so it returns false. 

You would use this method within your tests as follows:
```java
assertTrue(isSameList(actual, expected));
```
