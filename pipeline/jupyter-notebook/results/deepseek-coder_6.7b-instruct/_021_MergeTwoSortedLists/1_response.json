{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 91, "response": "The provided code is missing the closing brace (`}`) for the `mergeTwoLists` method. This will result in a compile-time error because the compiler expects to find a matching brace at the end of the method's definition. Here is your Java code with an added closing brace:\n\n```\npackage _021_MergeTwoSortedLists;\n\nimport com.leetcode.ListNode;\n\npublic class Practice {\n\n    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {\n        // Create a new list node that will be the head of our merged list\n        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);\n        \n        // Keep track of current position in the final merged list\n        ListNode prev = dummy;\n        \n        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {\n            if (l1.val <= l2.val) {\n                prev.next = l1;\n                l1 = l1.next;\n            } else {\n                prev.next = l2;\n                l2 = l2.next;\n            } \n            \n        // This is the closing brace for mergeTwoLists method\n        }\n        \n        if (l1 != null)\n            prev.next = l1;\n        else if (l2 != null)\n            prev.next = l2;\n    \n        return dummy.next;\n    }\n}\n```\nPlease ensure the `ListNode` class is available in your project for this to compile without error, as it's referenced in the code but not provided here. This solution assumes that you have a `ListNode` class with necessary properties and methods defined somewhere else in your project.\n"}
