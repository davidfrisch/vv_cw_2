{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 0, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": "Your tests are failing because the `mergeTwoLists` method in your `Practice` class seems to be returning a different result than what you expect. The issue could be that the method is not being implemented correctly, or there might be some logical error causing unexpected behavior. \n\nWithout seeing the implementation of `ListNode` and `isSameList` methods used for testing, it's hard to pinpoint the exact problem. However, based on your code, here are a few things you can check:\n\n1. Make sure that both linked lists (l1 and l2) are sorted in ascending order before they pass into the `mergeTwoLists` method. \n2. Check if the `ListNode` class's constructor is working as expected, especially its `val` field.\n3. The `isSameList` method you mentioned might have some issues with comparison of linked lists. Make sure it works correctly for your use case.\n4. Lastly, check that both `mergeTwoLists` and `isSameList` are implemented properly to match the expected behavior as per LeetCode problem description. \n\nIf you still can't find a solution, please provide more details about these methods or if any error messages were received while running your tests.\n"}
