The code you provided is already correct and should work as expected, assuming that the `ListNode` class has been properly defined elsewhere in your project (it's likely to be part of a larger package or library). 

If there are any errors in this snippet, it could be due to some other issues in the larger codebase. Please provide more context if you need help with something else.
