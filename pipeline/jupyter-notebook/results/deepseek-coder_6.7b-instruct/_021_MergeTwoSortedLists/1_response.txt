The provided code is missing the closing brace (`}`) for the `mergeTwoLists` method. This will result in a compile-time error because the compiler expects to find a matching brace at the end of the method's definition. Here is your Java code with an added closing brace:

```java
package _021_MergeTwoSortedLists;

import com.leetcode.ListNode;

public class Practice {

    public ListNode mergeTwoLists(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        // Create a new list node that will be the head of our merged list
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(-1);
        
        // Keep track of current position in the final merged list
        ListNode prev = dummy;
        
        while (l1 != null && l2 != null) {
            if (l1.val <= l2.val) {
                prev.next = l1;
                l1 = l1.next;
            } else {
                prev.next = l2;
                l2 = l2.next;
            } 
            
        // This is the closing brace for mergeTwoLists method
        }
        
        if (l1 != null)
            prev.next = l1;
        else if (l2 != null)
            prev.next = l2;
    
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
Please ensure the `ListNode` class is available in your project for this to compile without error, as it's referenced in the code but not provided here. This solution assumes that you have a `ListNode` class with necessary properties and methods defined somewhere else in your project.
