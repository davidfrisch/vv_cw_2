{"is_extracted": false, "number_of_code_blocks": 0, "extra_information_num_words": null, "response": "Based on the error message, it appears that Java cannot find the `Practice` class which is required for creating an instance of it (`new Practice()`). \n\nHere are a few things you can check to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Make sure that the `Practice` class exists and is in the same directory as `PracticeTest` or import it using the appropriate package statement if it's in another location.\n2. Ensure all your classes have correct file names, i.e., the filename must match the name of the public class inside that file (excluding .java extension). \n3. If you are using an IDE, ensure that the source folder is correctly set up and synced with the build path.\n4. Clean and rebuild your project.\n\nIf none of these suggestions solve your problem, please provide more context or further information about your code to help diagnose the issue better.\n"}
