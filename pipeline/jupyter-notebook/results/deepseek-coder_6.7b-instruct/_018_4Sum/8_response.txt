Your provided code snippet seems to be incomplete or malformed, as it does not actually contain a specific Java program or method to run. 

However, if you want an empty main method that can compile successfully, here's the complete code:

```java
import java.util.*; // This line imports ArrayList class and other utility classes used in this script

public class Main {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  }  // Empty main method
}
```
