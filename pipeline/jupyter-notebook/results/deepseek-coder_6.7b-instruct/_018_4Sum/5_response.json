{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 124, "response": "The errors you are seeing indicate that there is an issue with your Java file. However, without knowing what the `List` and `ArrayList` classes are, or how they work in general, it's impossible to provide a direct solution to this problem. The code provided seems fine as per standard syntax of java language but if you still face issues then make sure that you have imported necessary libraries at top of your file. \n\nFor example:\n```\nimport java.util.*; // This line imports the ArrayList class and other utility classes used in this script\n```\nAlso, ensure that 'Practice' class is a public one because it needs to be accessible outside its package for the method `fourSum` to work properly. \n\nIf you have done all these things correctly still face issues then provide more context about your complete code and I can help you further.\n"}
