Another issue could be that your file is named `PracticeTest.java` but you are trying to instantiate \"Practice\" which seems like it should be defined elsewhere. \n\nSince the error message doesn't provide specific information, it's difficult to give a precise solution.

This is a simple example of what a Makefile might look like to automate the build process for Java projects. \n\nPlease replace the directory paths with actual path if they are different.
