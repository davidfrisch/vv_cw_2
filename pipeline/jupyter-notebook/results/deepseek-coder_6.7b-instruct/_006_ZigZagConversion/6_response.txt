The error message indicates two problems in your Makefile. First, it seems like the clean and init rules are expecting a tab character instead of spaces at the beginning of their lines. Second, the compilation line is incorrectly indented. 

Here's the corrected version of your makefile:

```makefile
clean:
    [delete] Deleting directory /app/leetcode-master/bin
    [delete] Deleting directory /app/leetcode-master/report

init:
     [mkdir] Created dir: /app/leetcode-master/bin
     [mkdir] Created dir: /app/leetcode-master/report

compile.specific:
    javac /app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion/*.java -d /app/leetcode-master/bin
```
This should resolve the issues with your makefile and allow it to compile your Java source files correctly. Please replace "/app/leetcode-master" with the correct path in your system if necessary.
