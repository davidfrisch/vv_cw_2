{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 75, "response": "The error message indicates two problems in your Makefile. First, it seems like the clean and init rules are expecting a tab character instead of spaces at the beginning of their lines. Second, the compilation line is incorrectly indented. \n\nHere's the corrected version of your makefile:\n\n```makefile\nclean:\n    [delete] Deleting directory /app/leetcode-master/bin\n    [delete] Deleting directory /app/leetcode-master/report\n\ninit:\n     [mkdir] Created dir: /app/leetcode-master/bin\n     [mkdir] Created dir: /app/leetcode-master/report\n\ncompile.specific:\n    javac /app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion/*.java -d /app/leetcode-master/bin\n```\nThis should resolve the issues with your makefile and allow it to compile your Java source files correctly. Please replace \"/app/leetcode-master\" with the correct path in your system if necessary.\n"}
