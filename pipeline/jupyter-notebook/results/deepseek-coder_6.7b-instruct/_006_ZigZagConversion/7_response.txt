It seems like there are some syntax errors in your makefile and the Java code itself that's causing these problems. I can help you with making a correction to your makefile, but without seeing the actual file content of `Practice.java` or other source files in question, it will be difficult for me to provide a more specific solution.

However, based on common issues people run into when writing Makefiles, here is a general approach you might want to consider:

```makefile
# Define some variables that are used by targets
SRC_DIR = /app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion
BIN_DIR = /app/leetcode-master/bin

# Set the default target name
.DEFAULT_GOAL := all

# The 'clean' target deletes directories and files.
clean:
    rm -rf $(BIN_DIR)

# The 'init' target creates necessary directories.
init: 
    mkdir -p $(BIN_DIR)

# The 'compile.specific' target compiles the java code.
compile.specific: init
    javac $(SRC_DIR)/*.java -d $(BIN_DIR)
```
This makefile assumes you have Java installed and accessible via `javac` in your PATH, as well as GNU Make. This is a simple example of what a Makefile might look like to automate the build process for Java projects. 

Please replace the directory paths with actual path if they are different. If these don't work, you should debug and fix individual issues on a case by case basis based on error details provided in your question.
