It seems like there are some issues with your bash script and Java files. Here's the corrected code:

1. Remove the `bash` command at the beginning of the compile task in your Makefile, as it is not necessary and can cause problems:

    ```makefile
    compile.specific:
        javac /app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion/*.java -d /app/leetcode-master/bin
    ```
2. The error `unclosed comment` usually means that there's a missing closing double quote in your Java code somewhere, or the comment is not properly formatted. Without more context about your actual files, it's difficult to provide specific advice on this issue.

3. For the second error message you provided, it seems like the `javac` command is trying to compile a file named `bash` that doesn't exist in the specified directory. Ensure that the path to your Java source files is correct and points to existing Java files. 

Please replace these suggestions in your Makefile accordingly and try running again. If you continue to have issues, please provide more context or additional error messages for further assistance.
