Your Java code is fine. It defines two classes, `Practice` and `PracticeTest`. The problem might be due to how you are compiling these files or running them. Here's a sample command that may help in your case:

```bash
javac /app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion/*.java -d /app/leetcode-master/bin
```

This will compile all the Java files under `/app/leetcode-master/src/_006_ZigZagConversion` directory to the bin directory, which should resolve your error. Remember that you have to run this command every time when there are any changes in your source files. 

If you still face issues, please provide more context or details about how these files are being compiled and executed.
