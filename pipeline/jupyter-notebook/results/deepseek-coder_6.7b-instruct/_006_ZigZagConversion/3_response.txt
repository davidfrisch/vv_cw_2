The error message is indicating that it cannot find the definition for the classes "Practice" and "PracticeTest". It could be due to several reasons:

1. The class "Practice" might not exist or its location may not be recognized by the compiler. 
2. If this code was compiled in a different context, it might not know about the classes being used here.
3. Another issue could be that your file is named `PracticeTest.java` but you are trying to instantiate "Practice" which seems like it should be defined elsewhere. 

Since the error message doesn't provide specific information, it's difficult to give a precise solution. However, here is a general example of how your code could look:

```java
public class Practice {
    // Some methods and properties...
}

public class PracticeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Practice practice = new Practice();
        // Use the practice object to test your solution...
    }
}
```

In this example, `Practice` is defined in a separate file from `PracticeTest`. If these classes are not where you think they are or if there's another error elsewhere in your project, more information about the specific problem setup would be needed to provide a more accurate solution.
