Here's an example of what these classes could look like based on common assumptions about how a reverse integer function might be implemented:\n\n```\npackage _007_ReverseInteger;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public int reverse(int x) {\n        int result = 0;\n        \n        while (x != 0) {\n            if (result > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || result < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10) {\n                return 0; // handle overflow\n            }\n            \n            result = result * 10 + x % 10;\n            x = x / 10;\n        }\n        \n        return result;\n    }\n}\n```\n"}
