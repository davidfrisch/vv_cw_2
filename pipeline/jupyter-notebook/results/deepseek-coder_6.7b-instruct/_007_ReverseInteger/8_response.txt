It seems like the code snippet is incomplete and does not provide a definition for the `Practice` class or its `reverse()` method, which are necessary to run this main function. Here's an example of what these classes could look like based on common assumptions about how a reverse integer function might be implemented:

```java
package _007_ReverseInteger;

public class Practice {
    public int reverse(int x) {
        int result = 0;
        
        while (x != 0) {
            if (result > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || result < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10) {
                return 0; // handle overflow
            }
            
            result = result * 10 + x % 10;
            x = x / 10;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
