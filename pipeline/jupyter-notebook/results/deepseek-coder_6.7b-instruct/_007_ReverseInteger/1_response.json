The error message says that the class `App` should be in a file named `App.java` but it's located in `Practice.java`. \n\nSo, you need to rename your `_007_ReverseInteger/Practice.java` file to `_007_ReverseInteger/App.java` and then try running the build again. If this does not resolve the issue, there might be a problem with your project setup.\n"}
