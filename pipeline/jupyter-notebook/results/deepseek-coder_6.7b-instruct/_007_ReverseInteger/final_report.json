It does this by multiplying the current result by 10 to shift all digits one place to the left, then adding the last digit of 'a'. If at any point the result is larger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` or smaller than `Integer.MIN_VALUE`, it immediately returns 0. Finally, after we've processed all digits in 'a', we convert the result back to an int and return it.\n",
