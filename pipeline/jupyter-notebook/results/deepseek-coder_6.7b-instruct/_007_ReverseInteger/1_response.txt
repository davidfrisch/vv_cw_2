Your code is perfectly fine and does not have any syntax errors, so the issue seems to be with file naming. The error message says that the class `App` should be in a file named `App.java` but it's located in `Practice.java`. 

So, you need to rename your `_007_ReverseInteger/Practice.java` file to `_007_ReverseInteger/App.java` and then try running the build again. If this does not resolve the issue, there might be a problem with your project setup.
