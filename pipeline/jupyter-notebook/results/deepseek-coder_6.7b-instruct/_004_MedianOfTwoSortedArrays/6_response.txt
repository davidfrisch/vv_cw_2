The error message indicates that the Java compiler cannot find the class `Practice`. This can happen if your code is trying to instantiate a `Practice` object before its definition, which is not allowed in Java as it doesn't support forward references (i.e., referencing a class that hasn't been defined yet).

The error messages show the two instances where you are attempting to use `Practice`:
1. `Practice solution;` - Here, you're declaring an instance of the `Practice` class without initializing it (i.e., creating a reference to an object).
2. `solution = new Practice();` - This line is where you're trying to create a new `Practice` object using the constructor, which presumably exists in the `Practice` class definition but isn't shown here for brevity.

To fix these errors, make sure that both of these lines are placed after the declaration of the `Practice` class (or within a method where it can be accessed). For instance:
```java
public class PracticeTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Practice solution = new Practice(); // Now this line is legal.
        // The rest of your code...
    }
}
```
The `Practice` class definition is now visible to the compiler, allowing instances of it to be created in the `main` method as shown above. Make sure to adjust any other parts of your program that require access to the `Practice` class according to this pattern.
