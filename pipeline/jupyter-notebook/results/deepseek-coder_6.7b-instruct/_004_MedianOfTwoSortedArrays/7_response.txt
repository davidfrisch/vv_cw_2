The error message you provided suggests that it cannot find the `Practice` class in the specified directory. This might be because the file containing the `Practice` class is not in the right location, or perhaps the name of the file and the class inside it are not identical. 

However, without seeing the actual content of your source files, I can only suggest some general troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure that `Practice` class exists in a file named `PracticeTest.java` (notice the capitalization) in the specified directory. The error message suggests this but you mentioned it's "bad source file", so there might be something going wrong with your build system, not necessarily with the code itself.
2. Check if the classpath of your Java compiler includes the correct path to the directory where `PracticeTest.java` is located. The error message suggests that the file does not contain a `Practice` class but this could be misleading. It might help if you specify more about how and when the build process happens (e.g., what tools are used, how they're configured etc.) so I can provide more targeted advice.
3. If all else fails, try cleaning your project by deleting both `/app/leetcode-master/bin` and `/app/leetcode-master/report` directories before trying to compile again.
