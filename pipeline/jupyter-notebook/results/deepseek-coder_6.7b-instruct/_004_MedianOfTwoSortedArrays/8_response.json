It creates a new instance of class Practice inside the main method which is generally good practice since we might want to use its methods later on in our program. \n\nHowever, if you are seeing a specific error such as \"cannot find symbol\" or \"unexpected token\", please provide more context so that I can assist you better. Also, ensure that your Practice class definition exists and is accessible from the main method.\n"}
