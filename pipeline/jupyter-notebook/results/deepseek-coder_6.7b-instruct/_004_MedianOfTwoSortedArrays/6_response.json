{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 193, "response": "The error message indicates that the Java compiler cannot find the class `Practice`. This can happen if your code is trying to instantiate a `Practice` object before its definition, which is not allowed in Java as it doesn't support forward references (i.e., referencing a class that hasn't been defined yet).\n\nThe error messages show the two instances where you are attempting to use `Practice`:\n1. `Practice solution;` - Here, you're declaring an instance of the `Practice` class without initializing it (i.e., creating a reference to an object).\n2. `solution = new Practice();` - This line is where you're trying to create a new `Practice` object using the constructor, which presumably exists in the `Practice` class definition but isn't shown here for brevity.\n\nTo fix these errors, make sure that both of these lines are placed after the declaration of the `Practice` class (or within a method where it can be accessed). For instance:\n```\npublic class PracticeTest {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Practice solution = new Practice(); // Now this line is legal.\n        // The rest of your code...\n    }\n}\n```\nThe `Practice` class definition is now visible to the compiler, allowing instances of it to be created in the `main` method as shown above. Make sure to adjust any other parts of your program that require access to the `Practice` class according to this pattern.\n"}
