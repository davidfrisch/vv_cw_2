The error in your code is that it's trying to use a class named `Practice` before its declaration. In Java, classes must be declared and used at the same time or you will get a compile-time error. 

Here is the corrected version of your code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Practice {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Merging both arrays
        int totalLength = nums1.length + nums2.length;
        int[] mergedArray = new int[totalLength];
        
        System.arraycopy(nums1, 0, mergedArray, 0, nums1.length);
        System.arraycopy(nums2, 0, mergedArray, nums1.length, nums2.length);
    
        // Sorting the merged array
        Arrays.sort(mergedArray);
        
        // If total elements are even then median will be average of two middle numbers
        if (totalLength % 2 == 0) {
            return ((double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2] + (double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2 - 1]) / 2;
        } else { // If total elements are odd then median will be middle number of sorted array
            return (double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2];
        }
    }
}
```

Please ensure that this class `Practice` is used in another class, which might have the line `Practice solution;` and `solution = new Practice();`. Please replace them with actual class name where you are using `Practice` class. If it's still not working then please provide more context or related code so I can assist further.
