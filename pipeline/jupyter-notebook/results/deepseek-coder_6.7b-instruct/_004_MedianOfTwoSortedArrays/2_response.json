{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 89, "response": "The error is caused by the `TODO` comment in your code. This prevents Java compiler from executing any code as result of a missing implementation for the method findMedianSortedArrays(). You should delete this comment or provide an actual implementation. \n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```\npackage _004_MedianOfTwoSortedArrays;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {\n        // Your implementation goes here.\n    }\n}\n``` \n\nIf you need an example of how to implement this function, it can be complex due to the time complexity requirement and it'll also require understanding about binary search and divide-and-conquer methodologies. This is a complex problem which involves knowledge in advanced data structures and algorithms.\n"}
