{"is_extracted": true, "number_of_code_blocks": 1, "extra_information_num_words": 98, "response": "The error in your code is that it's trying to use a class named `Practice` before its declaration. In Java, classes must be declared and used at the same time or you will get a compile-time error. \n\nHere is the corrected version of your code:\n\n```\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class Practice {\n    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {\n        // Merging both arrays\n        int totalLength = nums1.length + nums2.length;\n        int[] mergedArray = new int[totalLength];\n        \n        System.arraycopy(nums1, 0, mergedArray, 0, nums1.length);\n        System.arraycopy(nums2, 0, mergedArray, nums1.length, nums2.length);\n    \n        // Sorting the merged array\n        Arrays.sort(mergedArray);\n        \n        // If total elements are even then median will be average of two middle numbers\n        if (totalLength % 2 == 0) {\n            return ((double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2] + (double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2 - 1]) / 2;\n        } else { // If total elements are odd then median will be middle number of sorted array\n            return (double) mergedArray[totalLength / 2];\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nPlease ensure that this class `Practice` is used in another class, which might have the line `Practice solution;` and `solution = new Practice();`. Please replace them with actual class name where you are using `Practice` class. If it's still not working then please provide more context or related code so I can assist further.\n"}
