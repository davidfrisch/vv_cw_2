Here is the complete solution code to your problem statement in Java. This solution uses a HashMap which stores elements and their indices as key-value pairs. It then iterates over the array, checking if the complement (target - current number) already exists in the map or not. If it does exist, that means we have found two numbers that add up to target so we return their indices.

```java
package _001_TwoSum;

import java.util.HashMap;

public class Practice {

    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {
                return new int[] { map.get(target - nums[i]) + 1, i + 1 };  // +1 because indices are not zero-based
           // TODO Auto-generated method stubï»¿<!--
