This solution uses a HashMap which stores elements and their indices as key-value pairs. It then iterates over the array, checking if the complement (target - current number) already exists in the map or not. If it does exist, that means we have found two numbers that add up to target so we return their indices.\n\n```java\npackage _001_TwoSum;\n\nimport java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic class Practice {\n\n    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {\n        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();\n        \n        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {\n            if (map.containsKey(target - nums[i])) {\n                return new int[] { map.get(target - nums[i]) + 1, i + 1 };  // +1 because indices are not zero-based\n           // TODO Auto-generated method stub\ufeff<!--\n.. title: About Me\n.. slug: aboutme\n.. date: 2016-08-31 23:59:59 UTC+08:00\n.. tags: \n.. category: \n\n.. link: http://www.davidliu.org\n.. description: David Liu's About Me Page\n.. type: text\n-->\n\nHello, I am a software developer based in Guangzhou, China.
